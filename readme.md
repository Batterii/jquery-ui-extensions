This repository is not actively maintained. It works with whatever version of
jQuery UI is used in the demos. There are no tests and I don't use any of these
in any of my code anywhere. Individual extensions may or may not work with newer
version of jQuery UI.

At some point in 2013, I will update all of this code, add tests, support
multiple versions of jQuery UI, create several more extensions and post these
on the new plugins site.
